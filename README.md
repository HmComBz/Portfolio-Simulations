# Portfolio-Simulations

In order to decide if one should rebalance a stock portfolio or just leave it as it is. I decided to run some simulations. Collecting data via an API from a company 
providing stock related data I collected 20 years of data for 6000 companies globally. I filtered at profitable companies to have some kind of selection.

Then during theses 20 years I ran simulations of different portfolio sizes, and different time periods. The results where as follows after thousands of random portfolios:

## No rebalancing:
Minimum average annual return   0%
Maximum average annual return   33%

## Rebalancing:
Minimum average annual return   9.5%
Maximum average annual return   24%

For me as a defensive investor, who focuses on statistics rather than individal excellence, this is a good argument for rebalancing the portfolio every year.
The intervall between the worst and the best are far less and even if you, though highly unlikely, selects the worst one out of thousands of portfolios, 
you still get good returns. The human belief in skills vs. randomness should not be ignored.
